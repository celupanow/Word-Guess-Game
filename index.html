    // time for pseudocode yo!//

    //word guess game//

    //first we'll need an array of words, probably, for peeps to guess//

    var breakfastFoods = ["pancakes", "over easy", "bacon", "eggs benedict", "syrup", "waffles", "oatmeal", "hasbrowns"];

    //then we'll need something like Press a key to start playing or whatevs.//

    //we'll need a function here to choose a random word from the array//

    //I'm thinking we're gonna need a butt load of if else statements to go through each word.
    //I'm wondering if there is a faster way to do it, but probably not lol.//

    //then we'll need an incrementing wins//

    //incrementing guesses - number of guesses remaining//

    //then we'll need something that keeps track of the guessed letters//

    //something that will make the letters _ _ _ like that until the right letter is guessed//

    //my psuedocode is ridiculous, but listen nobody else is gonna see it so it's okay for now 
    //what can I say, this is how I roll
    //the burden of being creative omg
    //what a hard life I have
    //also my cat is being ridiculous 
    //am I really surprised?
    //no
    //no I'm not
